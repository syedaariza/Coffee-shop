    <h1>What Is Coffee? History & Benefits </h1>

    <p>What is coffee? The stuff that lets you get out of bed and off to work in the morning.
      What is coffee? The common language of business breakfasts and get-togethers with friends.
      What is coffee? The beverage that helps you take a few minutes to calm down, relax and think.
      What is coffee? The perfect cap on a perfect meal.
      What is coffee? It’s absolutely, incredibly delicious – when it’s made properly.
      
      We all know the role that coffee plays in our life, and we all have our favorite times of day or favorite people to drink it with.
      
      To be honest, though, that’s not really what coffee is. It’s just how we use it and why we love it.
      
      62% of Americans drink coffee every day. They drink an average of more than three cups of coffee or specialty coffee each day. The newfound popularity of coffee drinks has sent the numbers soaring; the sale of lattes, cappuccinos and flat whites has increased by an amazing 50% over the last five years. And the USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) predicts another strong increase for coffee imports over the coming year.
      
      You’re probably in that group, yet you likely know very little about the beverage that’s such a big part of your everyday life. Aren’t you just a little curious to learn more about coffee?
      
      We knew you would be.</p>
  
      <h1>Types of Coffee</h1>
      <p>Ask a group of people to name their favorite type of coffee, and the vast majority will probably name varieties or flavors like latte, instant coffee, iced coffee, decaf, or “with milk and sugar.”
  
        That’s putting the cart before the horse, though. Let’s first consider the types of coffee beans, types of roast and brewing methods that are used to produce all of those varieties and flavors.</p>
  
        <h4>Coffee Beans:</h4>
        <p>There are two predominant types of coffee beans, Arabica and Robusta. (Lighter Excelsa beans and powerful Liberica beans are mostly found in Asia, but are occasionally carried by specialty coffee vendors.)
  
          Arabica beans are the most popular because of their quality, with nearly two-thirds of the world’s coffee produced from them. Generally speaking, Arabica coffee isn’t bitter; it’s smooth and flavorful with more acidity – and it’s more expensive to grow, because the plants can only be cultivated at higher altitudes with extra shade and water. Those are the reasons why 100% Arabica coffee is a favorite with coffee drinkers, and the pricier choice.
          Robusta beans are hardier and easier to grow, so they’re less expensive to buy. They’re also stronger with more bitterness and a lot more caffeine, making Robusta coffee harsher and, for most people, less desirable. Why do coffee roasters buy them? Because they can make a good profit by selling cheaper coffee – and because many espresso blends include a small percentage of Robusta beans in order to boost caffeine levels and produce a better crema.</p>
  
          <h4>Coffee Roasts:</h4>
          <p>Everyone who drinks coffee has heard of light, medium and dark roasts. But even many coffee lovers can’t provide exact definitions for them. Let’s take care of that.
  
            Roasted coffee supplanted boiled coffee centuries ago, but the modern-day process of roasting coffee beans didn’t really take shape until the mid-19th century, when large-scale commercial roasters were patented and became available to coffee producers.
            Here’s what to expect from each of the common roasts.
  
            Light Roast: Higher acidity, light flavor and aroma. (Examples are city roast and cinnamon roast.)
            Medium Roast: Stronger flavor but not overpowering, some roast taste, most popular in America. (Examples are American roast and breakfast roast.)
            Dark Roast: Rich and dark, strong aroma and flavor, noticeable bitterness, less acidity. (Examples are French roast and espresso roast.)</p>
  
            <h1>Health Benefits of Coffee</h1>
            <p>There can be no definitive summary of coffee’s health benefits, since some of the research is preliminary and many other possibilities are still being investigated. But coffee contains a number of vitamins (B2, B3 among them), minerals (including potassium and magnesium), and powerful antioxidants (like caffeic and chlorogenic acids). Those apparently contribute to these (and other) potential benefits of drinking coffee regularly.
  
              Large studies and meta-analyses of research involving coffee drinkers show that they have about a 10% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes, along with lower risks of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. 3-4 cups per day seems to be the “sweet spot.”</p>
  
  
    <h1>Coffee Nescafe</h1>
    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in
      the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green
      coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which
      is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of
      coffee. <br> <br> Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans,
      primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared and
      presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is
      usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often
      used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert,
      like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee
      shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis). Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee
      consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether
      long-term consumption has positive or negative effects.</p>
  
    <h1>Nutrition</h1>
    <p>Brewed coffee from typical grounds prepared with tap water contains 40 mg caffeine per 100 gram and no essential
      nutrients in significant content. In espresso, however, likely due to its higher amount of suspended solids, there
      are significant contents of magnesium, the B vitamins, niacin and riboflavin, and 212 mg of caffeine per 100 grams
      of grounds.</p>
